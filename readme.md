# Documentation and default values for Java configuration properties, defined as records or lombokked classes

default values are shown, documentation is shown for lombok, but not for the records

https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-365127
Update: in 253.*, the default values are shown for the properties defined as records.
However, the documentation is still not shown.


Also:
default values are not shown for any enum-type properties
default values are not shown for any collection of POJO or Map of POJO properties
